# Summary and Quick Usage Information
Simple file uploader based on BreakShoot's AnonFileAPI library. 
AnonFileUploader can integrate into the shell, thus making you able to right-click and upload any file you want at any location.
Normal usage is simple, drag & drop the target file that you want to upload over the executable file called, 'upload.exe' and then follow the instructions that will be displayed inside the console window. Stupidly simple. :)

# How to Integrate AnonFileUploader Into the Shell
Put the release folder (AnonFile Uploader) containing the required files into the 'Program Files (x86)' directory.
Once this is done, run the registry file (Shell-Integration.reg) to add the needed values within the registry.
If you want, you can also change the icon by just simply altering the 'icon.ico' file that's located inside the AnonFile Uploader folder.
And voila, now you can right-click on any file you want and upload it by clicking 'Upload file to AnonFile'.

Major thanks for his work, since otherwise, I would've been too lazy to create the API function on my own.
So all in all, credits go to BreakShoot for the awesome and simple to use, API library file. Which basically is the core of this application.
